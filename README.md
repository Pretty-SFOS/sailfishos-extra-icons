Collection of icons, missing in SailfishOS by default, made by @gregguh on Telegram.

Example use:
1. Add icons to resource file (add resource file if you don't have it) [](https://github.com/Michal-Szczepaniak/microtube/blob/master/qml/resources/resources.qrc)
2. Use them in qml files [](https://github.com/Michal-Szczepaniak/microtube/blob/master/qml/pages/VideoPlayer.qml#L474)
